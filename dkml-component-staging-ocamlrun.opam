  # Homebrew's bundle tap, needed for reproducible build auditing in drc's crossplatform-functions.sh.
  #
  # The Opam sandbox will stop Homebrew from auto-installing its own tap. In particular 'brew bundle ...'
  # is automatically installed per https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-bundle/tree/4756e4c4cf95485c5ea4da27375946c1dac2c71d#installation,
  # and it is an "official" tap per
  # https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/master/Library/Homebrew/official_taps.rb#L11-L18 .
  #
  # So our solution is to:
  # a) Use extra-source:[] to download a Git tarball without tripping over the sandbox firewall
  # b) Recreate a local file git repository
  # c) Use the next build:[] steps to let Homebrew know about the bundle tap
  #
  # Test with: brew untap homebrew/bundle
